- make it compatible with caves / more then host player

- maxwellshome is suddenly the other way round? The whole world as at 180 ° rotated


-- TO DO :
- [00:02:24]: Missing reference: 101481 - maxwelllock -> 103609 103609 - diviningrod (LIMBO)

- Replace all GetPlayer or ThePlayer with a AllPlayers for loop if it is to happen to all players

- at throne make still, that maxwell is there and that player is then put on throne ... or do I need for puppets? otherwise download puppest mod
- Maxwell is currently sitting on the throne after the game is over, but not before?!

- at worldjump evlt also save the selected char and take over -> no idea how

- if all goes well you could evlt a caves level add, in which case tintybyte duch smallbyte -> 63 level must be changed

- maxwell + stunned at the level beginning can directly into PlayerPostInit pure and startstuff component it remembers then pro player and it is executed as a client ... then you probably need netvars for


--can't find grass_umbrella_blueprint -> probably because it is still buildable

- the blueprints, on the other hand, have to be distributed in a meaningful order ... and it must also be taken into account in which level we are ...
- one possibility would be to integrate them into setpieces. but still the problem of the worlds .. -> before exactly think in which level which blueprints could be
- optional blueprints can be randomly distributed or offered at the shop (if both happen, then after picking in the shop price reduce to 1? is that possible? Yes with GLOBAL.AllRecipes)


- COOP tasks:
- Things can be checked with playerprox if he is near player, and if so, with some other object trigger something, so that player can go through or so
- to solve the number problem, you could always check with aLLPlayers the number. if only one player is there, the lock is just normal sanity obelisk.
- but are two or more players active, then the rounded half of all players must be on a certain position, so obelisekn go down (shopkeeper can hint)
- At least one person has to enter a place through and on the other side, so that obeliksen disappear permanently (even if only 1 player remains there)

- in summer levels, you have to get used to ice and gears ...

- test if adventure and worldjump funzt if one of the players is a ghost


- Build statue / wes_enemywave, evlt in maxwellhome as a final fight?

- Mod must iwie still be forced to adventure, so aufjedenfall no wilderness with several spawnpoints is selectable.


- anim inactive trap_teeth_maxwell ... hmm the anim file is actually ... so where is the error?

- sound from phonograph no longer funzt


- two worlds world. world generation took a long time, because he had too many unconnected tiles as in archipelago. But in the end world was ready, even though logfile wormholes are still unconnected ?!
- -> Everything is connected, so there are no islands. That's why it's probably successful.

- harness the teleoprtato in maxwellhome evlt to start the adventure from scratch? then char has to reappear, so you can move again

- some blueprints can also be bought more expensive directly in the shop.


- try diviningrod out of game to destroy if it is irreplacable.

- install automatic health adjustment and install in this then adventure check. From the settings only the Quicksettings with "off" take over.
- may also incorporate increased animals, so there are more hostile creatures depending on the level of difficulty

- with caves test -> cave made small and gives no inputs.
- With cave enabled clientversion can now be tested.
- If maxwell talks camera is not yet as a rangezoomt client ... is because of course that maxwell and its maxwelltalker componente is created only for the server ...
- you would have to get the camera commands out there and pack them in modmain, so that they can also be executed by client ... then, of course, applies to the maxwellthrone kram -.-
- otherwise you could also use a netvar, eg the TitleStuff variable, and then change the camera for certain values ​​in the listener function and change the value in the maxwellcomponent ...
- -> yes works with netvar! :) .. where there were reports that it does not funzt?

- two-worlds: berrybush_juicy cant find prefab


- the whole netvars may save better in world instead of in player inst?


- new clockwork craft setpiece is in chapter 0?! let in, or not?
